It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (the schedule can be found [here](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or Campuswire. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. "

    "\n",
    "UCSD is launching its own car dealership called Tritonmobile! Every UCSD student that buys a Tritonmobile will have 5 years to pay off a car loan, plus they'll get a special Triton discount. You and Charlie have been hired as data scientists for the project. Your job is to make a monthly car-payment calculator for the Tritonmobile website. \n",
    "\n",
    "Car payments depend on a few factors, including the price of the car, the amount paid up-front (called the down payment), the interest rate, and the length of the loan (in this case, 5 years). \n",
    "\n",
    "Tritonmobile will use a student's credit score to determine their interest rate. Interest is essentially the cost of borrowing money - it is money paid on top of borrowed money. Interest rates are mainly decided based on a person's credit score, which is a way of measuring financial trustworthiness. To learn more about this, check out [this article](https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/personal-finance/articles/-/learn/what-do-interest-rates-mean/) about what interest rates mean and [this article](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/why-do-people-with-higher-credit-scores-get-lower-interest-rates/#:~:text=People%20with%20higher%20credit%20scores,always%20looking%20to%20minimize%20risk.) about why credit scores affect interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through how Tritonmobile will calculate the loan payment on a \\\\$20,000 car with a $5,000 down payment, when the vehicle is sold to a student with a credit score of 750. The steps are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate the interest rate of the loan based on the credit score**.  Tritonmobile determines the interest rate according to the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Credit Rating |  Credit Score |Interest Rate |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| super prime | 781 and above | 5.6% |\n",
    "| prime | 661 to 780 | 6.9% |\n",
    "| near prime | 601 to 660 |  9.3% |\n",
    "| subprime | 501 to 600 |  11.9% |\n",
    "| deep subprime | up to 500 | 14.2% |\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, if the car buyer has a 750 credit score, their interest rate is 6.9\\%. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the principal amount on the loan using the down payment**. The principal amount is how much money you have to pay off (through monthly installments) after giving a down payment. This is usually calculated by simply subtracting the down payment from the cost of the car. However, Tritonmobile is offering a special discount for UCSD students called the Triton discount that lowers the principal even further. The higher the down payment, then the higher the discount. The Triton discount is determined by the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Down Payment as Percentage of Cost | Triton Discount |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| [0%, 10%) | 2% |\n",
    "| [10%, 20%) | 5% |\n",
    "| [20%, 30%) | 9% |\n",
    "| [30%, 40%) | 14% |\n",
    "| 40% or above | 20% |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the notation $[a, b)$ means \"greater than or equal to $a$ and less than $b$\". For example, a down payment that is equal to 9.9% of the total payment earns the buyer a 2% Triton discount, but 10% earns a 5% discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, a down payment of \\\\$5,000 on a \\\\$20,000 car means the down payment already covers 25% of the cost of the car. According to the table above, with 25% of the cost of the car already covered by the down payment, the Triton discount is 9%. This discount is applied to the remaining balance of the car after the down payment, which is \\$15,000. So the buyer gets an additional discount of \\\\$1,350, which comes from 9\\% of \\\\$15,000. This means that instead of having to pay off \\\\$15,000 through monthly installments, they only need to pay off \\\\$13,650 (which is \\\\$1,350 less than \\\\$15,000).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the monthly payment based on the interest rate and principal.** The formula below details how to calculate the monthly payment. This is called the *annuity* formula and it's widely used to determine monthly loan payments, a process known as [*amortization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator). \n",
    "    \n",
    "$$ \\text{monthly car payment} = \\text{principal} \\cdot\\frac{\\frac{\\text{interest}}{12}}{1-\\left(1+ \\frac{\\text{interest}}{12}\\right)^{-\\text{number of months}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we previously calculated the interest rate to be 6.9\\% (or 0.069 as a proportion) and the principal to be \\\\$13,650. A five year loan is 60 months. Plugging these values into the formula yields $270, which is the monthly payment.\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose UCSD holds a lottery in celebration of the men's basketball team's [exciting win at Spirit Night](https://ucsdtritons.com/news/2024/1/25/mens-basketball-tritons-hang-on-for-spirit-night-win.aspx). In this lottery, students can enter to win Triton Cash, or even free housing! Here's how the Spirit Night Lotto works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, you pick five **different** numbers, one at a time, from 1 to 66, representing the winning score at the Spirit Night game.\n",
    "- Then, you separately pick a number from 1 to 15. This is because the top scoring athlete (Bryce Pope) scored 15 points during the game. Let's say you select 9.\n",
    "- The six numbers you have selected, or  **your numbers**, can be represented all together as (7, 32, 24, 65, 13, 9). This is a _sequence_ of six numbers – **order matters**!\n",
    "\n",
    "The **winning numbers** are chosen by King Triton, who draws five balls, one at a time, **without replacement**, from a pot of white balls numbered 1 to 66. Then, he draws a gold ball, the Tritonball, from a pot of gold balls numbered 1 to 15. Both pots are completely separate, hence the different ball colors. For example, maybe the winning numbers are (65, 9, 24, 23, 1, 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll assume for this problem that in order to win the grand prize (free housing), all six of your numbers need to match the winning numbers and be in the **exact same positions**. In other words, your entire sequence of numbers must be exactly the same as King Triton's sequence of winning numbers. However, if some numbers in your sequence match up with the corresponding number in the winning sequence, you will still win some Triton Cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose again that you select (7, 32, 24, 65, 13, 9) and the winning numbers are (65, 9, 24, 23, 1, 9). In this case, two of your numbers are considered to match two of the winning numbers. \n",
    "- Your numbers: (7, 32, **24**, 65, 13, **9**)\n",
    "- Winning numbers: (65, 9, **24**, 23, 1, **9**)\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't win free housing, but you will win some Triton Cash. Note that although both sequences include the number 65 within the first five numbers (representing a white ball), since they are in different positions, that's not considered a match.\n"
